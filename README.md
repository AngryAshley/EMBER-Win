# EMBER-Win
An amateuristic attempt at creating artificial sentience. For fun, really. For Windows, too.

Ember is a project of mine in which I attempt to create some form of sentient artificial intelligence.
I want to make a "chatbot" type of program with an emphasis on emotions and feelings, where the emotional system is modular and controlled by "Personality constructs".
It's a lot like GLaDOS, because how couldn't I inspire this on her. A large chunk of inspiration comes from an ARG I attempted to write back in 2017 as well, Project ASHLEY.
Project EMBER is her child, in many ways. EMBER is the spark of the torch that carries the fire of knowledge on.

I am planning on making a system in which multiple personality constructs can be loaded and put together. 
The first Personality Construct will be called Avery, designed to be as balanced as possible.
These constructs will all have positive and negative emotion modifier weights to simulate the proclivity to certain feelings and thoughts.
They will also all have memories, with associated feelings stored along with them.
To make everything complete, an RNG provides a certain level of variability which is only common in humans;
memories corrupt, moods swing, messages are misinterpreted, everything.
It's all an interesting experiment to me and I am extremely curious how it will turn out, how we will see all the systems manifest in the conversations with Avery and their friends.

I'm currently writing up a research report, which will be linked to here when it is in a readable state.

Eventually, I'm planning on writing a Linux version, hence why this project is called EMBER-Win.
