\eF___\eG About CreatureTel \eF______________\eE__\eG__\eG\n\r
CreatureTel is my Personal Playground\n\r
for all things Videotex.\n\n\r

Here, I try out new things that go\n\r
beyond the normal intention of Videotex\n\r
as well as experiments that help our\n\r
efforts of understanding the original\n\r
Prestel and Minitel protocols.\n\n\r

It's riddled with memes and jokes by\n\r
intention, this is the part of our\n\r
network where we have fun!\n\n\r
